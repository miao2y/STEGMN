## Abstract

Molecular trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials simulation. It aims to accurately infer the future 3D positions of atoms from historical conformational sequences. This enables the revelation of molecular dynamic behavior, prediction of reaction pathways, and assessment of conformational stability. Due to its inherent compatibility with graph-structured representations and spatiotemporal dynamics, this task has become a critical frontier in GNN research.

However, current mainstream spatiotemporal GNNs face a key limitation in molecular trajectory modeling: their architectures do not explicitly encode rigid geometric constraints. Although existing models commonly enforce E(3)-equivariance to satisfy rotational, translational, and reflection symmetries, they essentially treat atoms as freely moving point masses. These models rely on data-driven learning to implicitly approximate structural constraints rather than explicitly encoding them at the architectural level. This often leads to unphysical deformations and undermines the physical interpretability of predictions.

To address this challenge, we propose STEGMN‚Äîthe first spatiotemporal graph architecture for molecular trajectory prediction that explicitly encodes rigid constraints. Inspired by Graph Mechanics Networks, we design a constraint-preserving equivariant spatiotemporal attention mechanism that captures temporal dependencies while rigorously maintaining both E(3)-equivariance and rigid-body constraints. Additionally, we introduce a constraint-preserving equivariant pooling module that generates future states by performing a learnable weighted aggregation of historical angular velocities, followed by forward kinematics mapping. This ensures that all outputs simultaneously satisfy E(3)-equivariance and strict bond-length conservation.

On real-world molecular dynamics datasets (rMD17 and AdK), STEGMN outperforms strong equivariant baselines, reducing prediction errors by 40% on average for small molecules‚Äîhighlighting the value of explicit constraint modeling for physically stable trajectory prediction.

## Model Architecture

**Overall Architecture of STEGMN**

The model takes molecular trajectory from time steps 0 to T-1 as input and predicts molecular spatial configuration at time step T. At each time step, atomic coordinates are first processed by a GMN-based spatial module to model local geometry and spatial interactions, enabling effective spatial feature fusion. Subsequently, temporal information is integrated via the Temporal Mechanics Attention Layer (TMAL). Spatial and temporal modules are applied alternately across layers to progressively fuse spatiotemporal features. Finally, the Temporal Mechanics Pooling Layer (TMPL) aggregates structural information to generate the system configuration at the next time step.

The overall architecture of STEGMN comprises the following core components:

1. **GMN-based Spatial Graph Mechanics Layer**: Adopts Graph Mechanics Networks as the foundational spatial modeling module, explicitly encoding rigid geometric constraints while ensuring E(3)-equivariance
2. **Temporal Mechanics Attention Layer (TMAL)**: Constraint-preserving equivariant spatiotemporal attention mechanism that uses angular acceleration as attention values for message aggregation
3. **Temporal Mechanics Pooling Layer (TMPL)**: Constraint-preserving equivariant pooling layer that predicts future states by learning weighted aggregation of historical angular velocities
